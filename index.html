        <h2>Senior in high school in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a dual credit student at Bob Jones University. I would like to be a double major of Biblical Counseling and Music (voice principle).</p>
         <p>
            I am a member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church. My favorite website is  
            <a href="https://stokescpas.com">here</a>, and you can email me  
            <a href="mailto:madeline@stokescpas.com">here</a>.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I enjoy singing classical vocal repertoire, playing hymns on the piano, and playing sacred hymn arrangements on the flute. I also enjoy having deep conversations and getting to know new people.
